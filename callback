A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to 
another function and is invoked (or "called back") at a later 
time when certain operations or events have been completed.

**Callbacks are used to ensure that certain code is executed only after a specific operation has been performed

....callback are specially used for asyncronpous function

<!-- JavaScript is asynchronous by nature, -->

************************
<!-- call stack being full -->

1.Recursive Function Without a Base Case: A recursive function is one that calls itself. If the recursion doesn't have a base case (a condition to stop), it will keep calling itself 

2.Deeply Nested Function Calls: Even if the functions are not recursive, if you have too many deeply nested function calls, the call stack can overflow
